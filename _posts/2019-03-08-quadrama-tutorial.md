I'm happy to announce that we will give a tutorial on quantitative drama analysis as part of the 2nd Heidelberg Computational Humanities Summer School. The tutorial will take place on Monday afternoon (July 15) and is held by the entire QuaDramA team. We will give a brief introduction into R and RStudio, but the main part will be a hands-on session using tools we develop(ed) within our project.
