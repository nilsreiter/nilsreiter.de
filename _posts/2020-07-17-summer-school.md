After a break, I'm again part of the Cologne summer school on deep learning for language analysis. This year's edition takes place from August 31 to September 4 online. I'll be giving a class on **Text Analysis with Deep Learning**.

Information on registration and application, as well as a schedule overview and additional activities can be found [here](https://ml-school.uni-koeln.de).
