![CRETA Verein](https://cretaverein.de/assets/img/Logo_creta_subline.svg) In October 2020, we have established CRETA e.V., a legan entity according to German law ("Verein"). The CRETA e.V. takes over from the eHumanities centre at Stuttgart University, but is no longer bound to Stuttgart. In fact, our members already come from different universities and places. In this new form, we will continue to work on different areas of reflected text analysis, having a platform that links specific research from individual projects. More on our mission can be found on our web page.
