![Logo]({% link /assets/2021-04-22-call-stss/logo.png %}) With colleagues from the universities WÃ¼rzburg and Darmstadt, I'm organising a shared task on scene segmentation: Scenes are time-, location- and plot-wise coherent units of a story, and can predominantly be found in narrative texts like novels or biographies. Registration is open until June 7, and the shared task is co-located with KONVENS 2021.
