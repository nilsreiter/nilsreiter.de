Report/hands-on tutorial by Elena Rogleva, Vanessa Schach, Amelie WÃ¼hrl & Nils Reiter, held during the workshop [Finding Metaphor in Discourse. An Intensive Training for Manual and Algorithmic Approaches to Metaphor](http://dhlab.unibas.ch/finding-metaphor-in-discourse/), November 8-9, 2018, at Basel University.

## Abstract
We will report on a project conducted during Summer 2018. Using an annotated corpus of metaphors and a large corpus of German literary fiction, we explored ways to automatically identify metaphors. The procedure is closely oriented along the lines of the MIP/MIPVU annotation scheme, and uses vector space to learn a distributional dictionary from scratch. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of automatic metaphor detection for German texts.
