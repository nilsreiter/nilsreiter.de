![Cologne](/assets/img/europe-4272297_1280.jpg) It's now official: On September 1st, I'll join the [Institute for Digital Humanities](https://dh.uni-koeln.de) at the University of Cologne. At the institute, I'll be an interim professor for linguistic information processing ("Sprachliche Informationsverarbeitung"). I'm looking forward to the new colleagues, students, institute, and city!
