I'm happy to announce that I'll be giving a two-day class on machine learning for reflected text analysis during the [late summer school in Cologne, Germany](http://ml-school.uni-koeln.de/). 

The class takes place on September 26 and 27, and its main goal is to convey a basic understanding of how machine learning algorithms work concretely. The class will include both a theoretical introduction into (some) algorithms as well as a hands-on session in the form of a small shared task using Python. Application deadline is on August 20.
