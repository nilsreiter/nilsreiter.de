I'm happy to announce that I'll be giving a two-day class on machine learning for reflected text analysis during the [late summer school in Cologne, Germany](http://ml-school.uni-koeln.de/). 

The class takes place on September 26 and 27, and its main goal is to convey a basic understanding of how machine learning algorithms work concretely. The class will include both a theoretical introduction into (some) algorithms as well as a hands-on session in the form of a small shared task using Python. Application deadline is on August 20.

Participants are asked to install the following things on their computers

### Python

- Python: If your computer already has Python 2, there is no need to update. If you're installing Python from scratch, please use Python 3.
- pip: The Python package manager
- The Python libraries `nltk` and `requests`.

Detailed instructions for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux can be found [here](/assets/2018-08-16-late-summer-school/installation-instructions.pdf) (PDF file). The file [test_install.py](/assets/2018-08-16-late-summer-school/test_install.py) can be used to test the installation.

### Text Editor

For editing Python files, participants will need a plain text editor. We recommend the following:

- Windows: [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)
- Mac OS X: [TextMate](https://macromates.com)
