![Book-Cover](/assets/img/RTA-book.png) Since 2015, I've been working in the eHumanities-Center [CRETA](https://www.creta.uni-stuttgart.de) at [Stuttgart University](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de). What we've been doing there and how it all fits together can (as of today) be read in a single volume, available both digitally in open-access as well as in print.
