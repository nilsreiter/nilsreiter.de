Starting October 1st, I'll be a full professor at the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de). My denomination will be "Digital Humanities â€“ Sprachliche Informationsverarbeitung", which is essentially DH and computational linguistics. This of course means that this is exactly the right position for me :-) I am very happy to join the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://dh.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de) and collaborate with colleagues at the [Cologne Center for eHumanities](https://cceh.uni-koeln.de), the [Data Center for the Humanities](https://dch.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de), the [CRC Prominence in Language](https://sfb1252.uni-koeln.de), the [Center for Data and Simulation Science](https://cds.uni-koeln.de/en/), and many more.
