## Shared Task

I am initiator of a group that wants to establish shared tasks in the Digital Humanities community. See [this web page for details](https://sharedtasksinthedh.github.io).

## DFG Priority Programme Computational Literary Studies

In June 2018, the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) approved a [priority programme *Computational Literary Studies* (CLS)](https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io). The programme comprises funding for about 15 projects in this area. Together with Fotis Jannidis, Evelyn Gius, Jonas Kuhn, Christof Schöch and Simone Winko, I am one of the applicants for the programme and a member of the coordinating committee.
