### Abstract

The article describes the idea, operationalization decisions and results of the first shared task in the Digital Humanities. In the task, different participating teams developed annotation guidelines for narrative levels independently. Annotation guidelines are a prerequisite for the development of systems for the automatic detection of textual phenomena, and thus needed in Computational Literary Studies because they allow large-scale studies of narrative phenomena. The developed guidelines were compared using a newly developed evaluation scheme that brings together the three dimensions of conceptual coverage, applicability and usefulness.
