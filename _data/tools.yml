  description: "CorefAnnotator is a tool for annotating coreference in texts. It has been developed to be able to cope with long texts with many different chains. The core idea is not to annotate binary relations between mentions (e.g., cataphoric), but to consider all mentions that co-refer to form an equivalence set. Consequently, the tool displays a list of entities on the right and allows free assignment of text spans to these entities."

  citation: Kuthy2018aa
  description: "TreeAnno is a web-based tool to annotate tree structures on texts. Instead of drawing relations with pointing device, sentences or tokens can be indented. This makes the tool similar to an outliner (which is also its inspiration source). Under the hood, indentations are stored as trees on text snippets encoded via their character offsets. The tool has been used to annotate information structure in interactive texts."
