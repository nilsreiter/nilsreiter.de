Nils Reiter studied computational linguistics and computer science at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/nc/en/home.html). He did his PhD in a collaboration project between classical indology and computational linguistics at Heidelberg University ([SFB on ritual dynamics](http://ritualdynamik.de/index.php?id=1&L=1)). He now works at [Stuttgart University](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/index.html) as a scientific coordinator and investigator in the Centre for Reflected Text Analytics ([CRETA](https://www.creta.uni-stuttgart.de)). Since Summer 2017, he is also PI of the mixed-methods-Project [QuaDramA](https://quadrama.github.io)  on the quantitative analysis of dramatic texts. With colleagues, he initialized a [shared task](https://sharedtasksinthedh.github.io) with the goal of creating annotation guidelines for narrative levels. His research interests mostly are related to operationalization questions, particularly with respect to literary research questions and concepts.
